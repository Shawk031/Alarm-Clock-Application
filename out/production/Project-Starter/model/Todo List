Need to make sure the alarms legitimately ring

Need to add scrolling functionality
Need to add swapping status functionality
Need to add renaming functionality


Need to add a menu with buttons that DOESNT MOVE (think like the score panel.)
- yo I could make a whole new panel here that does this so the previous panel can register the inputs
and do things with them and can scroll without moving buttons
